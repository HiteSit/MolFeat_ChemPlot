ChemPlot: A python library for chemical space visualization
===========================================================

Last decades, Machine Learning (ML) applications have been a great impact on molecular
and material science. However, every ML model requires a definition of its applicability domain. 
We developed a python package, Chemplot, that allows users to plot the chemical space of their
datasets. Chemplot contains smart algorithms behind which uses both structural and tailored
similarity. Moreover, it is easy to use even for non-experts.

This guide provides the user with the explenantion of ChemPlot concepts and functionality.
